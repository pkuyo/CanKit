## 0.5.0

### Added

* **CanKit.Abstractions**: New project with a corresponding NuGet package.
* **Receive payload allocator**: `CanBus` receive path now supports an `IBufferAllocator` for `CanFrame` payloads to optimize memory usage and reduce GC. Two default implementations are included: `ArrayPoolBufferAllocator` and `DefaultBufferAllocator`.
* **Queued transmission**: Introduced `QueuedCanBus` that adds a TX queue to any existing bus. Create via `ICanBus.WithQueuedTx(QueuedCanBusOptions)`.

### Changed

* **Timing source**: ZLG and SocketCAN adapters now use `Stopwatch` instead of `Environment.TickCount` for more stable timing.

### Performance

* **Lower allocations on receive** via the allocator-based payload path.
* **Fewer conversions in hot paths** thanks to a unified frame type (see breaking changes).

### Breaking changes

* **Unified frame type**: Removed `ICanFrame`, `CanClassicFrame`, and `CanFdFrame`. Introduced a single `CanFrame` for all CAN frame kinds. Create frames using `CanFrame.Classic(...)`, `CanFrame.Fd(...)`, or `CanFrame.Create(...)`.

  * **Primary motivation**: Eliminate the boxing/unboxing and back-and-forth conversions between `ICanFrame` and concrete frame types, which previously added per-frame CPU overhead and extra allocations in hot paths. Unifying to `CanFrame` removes those interfaceâ€“concrete transitions and reduces GC pressure.
