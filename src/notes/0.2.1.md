**Reliability:**
- fixed VirtualBus receive handling.
- ensured adapters throw consistent disposal exceptions to prevent stuck listeners.
- corrected ZlgCanBus FrameReceived behavior so subscriptions receive frames as expected.

**Performance:** 
- reworked SocketCAN receive loops , reducing overhead and improving throughput under load.
- optimized Kvaser/PCAN transmit yielding faster benchmarks and removed timeout logic from PCAN/Kvaser transceivers.
