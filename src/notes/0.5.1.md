## 0.5.1

### Added

### Changed

* **`SocketCanBus` TX path**: Optimized the send logic to reduce GC allocations and overhead.
* **Adapter registration**: Refactored registration patterns and entry points to leave room for upcoming Transport/Protocol layers (ISO-TP work in progress).

### Fixed

* **`VectorBus` `accessMask`**: Corrected the way the `accessMask` is obtained.

### Performance

* **Lower allocations on transmit** via the optimized `SocketCanBus` send path.

### Breaking changes
