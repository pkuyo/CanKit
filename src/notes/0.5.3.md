## 0.5.3

### Added

* None.

### Changed

* **Receive path validation**: Tightened frame-length validation across all adapters so that incoming frames cannot exceed the underlying buffer or protocol limits. Invalid frames are now handled defensively instead of propagating unexpected sizes to the application.

### Fixed

* **`ArrayPoolBufferAllocator` `Memory` length**: Fixed an issue where the created `Memory` slice could expose a `Length` greater than the size of the rented buffer.
* **SocketCAN Classic receive payload size**: Corrected the maximum application data length for Classic CAN frames in the SocketCAN receive path from 64 bytes to 8 bytes.
* **Adapter receive robustness**: Added length constraints to the `Receive` implementations of other adapters to prevent exceptions when the underlying interface returns malformed or oversized data.

### Performance

* None.

### Breaking changes

* None. (Only invalid / over-sized frames are now rejected more defensively instead of causing exceptions.)
