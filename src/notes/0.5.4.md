## 0.5.4

### Added

* **`FaultOccurred`**: Introduced a new event for reporting unrecoverable faults.
* **`CanExceptionPolicy`**: Added a unified exception-handling policy to standardize how adapter/receive exceptions are classified and handled across the library.

### Changed

* **Remove unused duplicate adapter**: Removed the duplicated and unused `ZCAN_PCIE_CANFD_200U` entry/implementation.

### Fixed

* **`CancellationTokenSource` disposal**: Fixed an issue where some adapters could leak a `CancellationTokenSource` when `CanBus` was disposed or when the receive task stopped due to an exception.
* **Event handler isolation**: Fixed an issue where exceptions thrown inside `FrameReceive` / `ErrorOccurred` subscriber callbacks could stop the receive thread. Subscriber exceptions are now contained and do not terminate the receive loop.

### Performance

* None.

### Breaking changes

* None. (Only invalid conditions and subscriber callback exceptions are handled more defensively; normal operation is unchanged.)
