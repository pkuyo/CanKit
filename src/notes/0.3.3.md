0.3.3

**Improved**

- `MaskFilter` and `RangeFilter` enums to CanFeature for more precise device capability detection.

**Fixed**
- Added exception handling around `Endpoint.Enumerate()` to prevent crashes when the required driver is not installed.
- Revised the criteria for software-substitute filtering on ZLG adapters to make the filtering semantics explicit.
